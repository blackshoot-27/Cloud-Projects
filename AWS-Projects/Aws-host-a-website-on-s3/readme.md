🚀 Just wrapped up a thrilling Amazon S3 project—challenge mode engaged! 🔍

![Website-Hosted](https://github.com/blackshoot-27/AWS-Projects/blob/main/Aws-host-a-website-on-s3/5.PNG?raw=true)

In this project, I:
✅ Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.
✅ Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.
✅ Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.

📸 See my journey from creating buckets to deploying a fully functional static website in my documentation below.

📢 Shoutout to all AWS learners—let's connect, share tips, and keep improving!
