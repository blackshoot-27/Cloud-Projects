# ðŸ“¢ AWS S3 Event-Driven Notification System (Lambda + SNS + SQS)

This project demonstrates a **serverless, event-driven architecture on AWS**, where **S3 object events (upload and delete)** trigger a **Lambda function**, which then sends **notifications via Amazon SNS (Email)** and **messages to an Amazon SQS queue**.

## âœ… AWS Services Used:

- **Amazon S3:**  
Triggers events on file creation (PUT) and deletion.

- **AWS Lambda:**  
Event handler written in Python (Boto3). It processes S3 event payloads and triggers notifications.

- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):**  
Sends email notifications for upload and delete events.

- **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):**  
Receives event metadata messages for later downstream processing.

---

## âœ… Features:

- Detects **file uploads** and **file deletions** in S3
- Sends **email alerts** for each event
- Pushes **structured metadata** (bucket, key, timestamp, event type) into SQS queue
- Fully **event-driven**, **serverless**, and **scalable**


## âœ… Deployment Steps:

1. **Create an S3 bucket** and enable event notifications for PUT and DELETE.
2. **Deploy a Lambda function** using the provided Python code.
3. **Attach necessary IAM roles**:
   - AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
   - SNS and SQS full access (or scoped permissions)
4. **Create an SNS topic** and **subscribe your email address**.
5. **Create an SQS queue** and get the queue URL.
6. **Update Lambda environment variables or hard-coded ARNs/URLs** for SNS topic and SQS queue.
7. **Test by uploading and deleting files in S3**.
