#Done in Aws Cloud techniqal Essentials
I'm excited to share a recent project where I designed and implemented a three-tier web application architecture on AWS. This project utilized a range of AWS services including Amazon EC2, VPC, DynamoDB, and Elastic Load Balancing, ensuring high availability, scalability, and security.

🔍 Project Highlights:

    Amazon VPC: Provided a secure and isolated network environment.
    EC2 Instances with Auto Scaling: Ensured reliable application performance.
    Elastic Load Balancer: Efficiently distributed traffic across multiple AZs.
    DynamoDB: Offered fast and scalable NoSQL database support.
    CloudWatch: Monitored application health and performance in real-time.

I’ve attached a screenshot of the architecture diagram for a closer look. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of cloud architecture and AWS services, and I’m eager to apply these skills to future challenges.
